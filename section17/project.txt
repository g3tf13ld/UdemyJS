I have provided you with a .js file with a story in it.

I want you to do the following to the story.
1. Find all instances of the word "cheeseburgers", and replace it with the word "hamburgers". Be sure to note the casing of the word.
2. Find all instances of the word "bun", and capitilize all the letters.

Then I want you to provide the following information using string methods.
1. How many characters are in the story?
2. How many words are in the story?

If you are curious where the story came from, check our http://cheeseburgeripsum.com/.
